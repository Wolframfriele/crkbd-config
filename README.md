# QMK Configuration for the crkbd/rev1

This is the current setup I run on the corne.

## Building and Flashing

To set up the environment follow the steps on: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started.

Then clone this repository to ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/crkbd/rev1/keymaps.

To build the firmware follow the steps on: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware.
Either use `crkbd-config` instead of github username, or change the name of the cloned folder.

For flashing the firmware onto a keyboard follow the steps in: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_flashing.
